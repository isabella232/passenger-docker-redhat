Passenger-docker-redhat is a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images meant to serve as good bases for **Ruby, Python, Node.js and Meteor** web app images. In line with [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/)'s goal, passenger-docker's goal is to make Docker image building for web apps much easier and faster.

Why is this image called "passenger"? It's to represent the ease: you just have to sit back and watch most of the heavy lifting being done for you. Passenger-docker-redhat is part of a larger and more ambitious project: to make web app deployment ridiculously simple, to heights never achieved before.
